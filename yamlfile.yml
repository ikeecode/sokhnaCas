description: "A tortoise's shell is made up of 60 different bones all connected to\
  \ each other The top of a tortoise's shell is called a \u201Ccarapace\u201D The\
  \ underside of the shell is called a \u201Cplastron\u201D The carapace and the plastron\
  \ of a tortoises shell is connected by what is known as a bridge Tortoises can retract\
  \ their heads and all their limbs including their tails into their shells when they\
  \ feel threatened or attacked by predators Tortoises have extremely strong mouths\
  \ but no teeth instead they have horny type beaks Tortoises have good all round\
  \ vision and a very good sense of smell Tortoises are cold-blooded \u2013 they draw\
  \ heat from their environment and are more active during the day than at night Tortoises\
  \ can live a very long time, some to the ripe old age of 150. However, the average\
  \ age a tortoise can live to ranges from 90 to 150 years Tortoises are what is known\
  \ as herbivores, they eat grass, ferns, flowers, tree leaves and fruit Female tortoises\
  \ are usually larger than their male counterparts Females dig burrows in which they\
  \ can lay up anything from 1 to 30 eggs A male tortoise has a longer tail than that\
  \ of a female, which is one way of sexing them When baby tortoises break out of\
  \ their shells they are called hatchlingsTortoise eggs incubate between 90 to 120\
  \ days to hatch out Tortoises hibernate in the winter time and before they do, they\
  \ starve themselves so their stomachs are empty ready for hibernation"
